# MyReads Project

This website wa a built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.



## How to Load the App

You can run a hosted version of the app at http://myreads-quinntoncato.surge.sh/

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/qcardell/myread.gito
```
```
npm install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

## How to Use the App
